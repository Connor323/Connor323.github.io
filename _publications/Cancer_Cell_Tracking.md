This project focuses on cell tracking based on [Li et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846554/). By utilizing watershed algorithm and feature vectors (based on position, shape, spatial distribution and texture), the algorithm can succeed tracking cancer cells in image sequence with segmentation accuracy and tracking accuracy 69.51% and 76.78%, repectively.
